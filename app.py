            This tool analyzes current MLB players' hitting performance using three key metrics:
            - **Batting Average (BA)** - How often they get hits
            - **On-Base Percentage (OBP)** - How often they reach base  
            - **On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS)** - Combined power and on-base ability
